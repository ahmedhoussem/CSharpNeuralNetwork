# CSharpNeuralNetwork
A simple Neural network with gradient decent implementation with the ability to save and load the NN from file :)

A simple implementation a neural network with simple console application XOR to show and test the use of the NN

## Next step :
- More code polish and improve of training speed and make the use of the NN simpler
- Add an example made with Unity3D showing AI enemies trained using this NN
